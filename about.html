            <h2>What is it?</h2>
            <p>
                Naawi-Oodena is a significant Indigenous-led urban development located in Winnipeg on the former Kapyong Barracks site. 
                The land was reclaimed by Treaty One First Nations after years of legal action and negotiation, 
                marking a major step in restoring treaty lands to Indigenous stewardship.

            <h2>What is it for?</h2>
            <p>
                The project was designed to be Canadaâ€™s largest urban reserve, with plans for thousands of homes and over a million square feet of commercial space. 
                This development will generate substantial economic activity, creating jobs, training opportunities, and long-term business growth for Indigenous communities.

            <h2>What else?</h2>
            <p>
                Beyond economics, Naawi-Oodena is a cultural landmark. It will feature Indigenous design, language, and art, 
                helping to revitalize and celebrate Indigenous culture in an urban setting. 
                The community will serve not just as a residential and commercial area, but as a place of cultural expression and pride.

            <h2>Reconciliation</h2>
            <p>
                Naawi-Oodena represents a new model of reconciliation and collaboration. 
                Through partnerships with municipal and federal governments, the project supports 
                Indigenous self-governance and showcases what respectful, cooperative development can look like in Canada.
