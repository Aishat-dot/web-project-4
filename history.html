                <h2>Kapyong Barracks</h2>
                <p>
                    Naawi-Oodena is located on the former site of the Kapyong Barracks, a military base previously used by the Canadian Forces. 
                    The base was vacated in 2004. 
                    After its closure, the federal government planned to transfer the land to the Canada Lands Company for redevelopment, 
                    which sparked interest and legal action from Treaty One First Nations due to outstanding land claims.

                <h2>Land Claim</h2>
                <p>
                    Several Treaty One First Nations opposed the federal government’s plan to transfer the former Kapyong Barracks land, 
                    citing their right to consultation due to unresolved treaty land entitlements. 
                    They took the matter to court, asserting that the government had a legal duty to engage with them before making decisions about the land. 
                    In 2015, the federal court ruled in favor of the First Nations, stating that the 
                    Crown had indeed failed to fulfill its obligation to consult and accommodate the Treaty One Nations. 
                    This ruling was a key moment in advancing Indigenous land rights.

                <h2>Launch</h2>
                <p>In 2019, Treaty One First Nations and the Canadian government signed a landmark agreement returning the former Kapyong Barracks to 
                    Indigenous stewardship. Renamed Naawi-Oodena, meaning “Centre of the Heart and Community,” the site is envisioned as a vibrant urban reserve. 
                    Plans include housing, commercial space, cultural and governance institutions, and educational and recreational facilities, 
                    all rooted in First Nations identity and focused on reconciliation, community building, and economic development.
